Determining the proportion of N removal lost to denitrification is important because it can completely remove N from water and return it to the atmosphere. There are multiple ways to measure denitrification, but they all have advantages and disadvantages. Many studies have estimated the influence of various wetland plants on denitrification rates, but reported rates span 6 orders of magnitude and depend on method used, plant communities, wetland type and scale.  Studies using different techniques on the same plant community are lacking. To estimate the influence wetland macrophytes have on denitrification rates, I propose comparing the change in N concentration in mesocosms vegetated with L. oryzoides, T. domingensis, and S. tabernaemontani to determine if vegetation affects the rate of nitrate removal.
